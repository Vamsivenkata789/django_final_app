## Implementation Action Points

1. Remove all references to course/group models/views/UI.
2. Use only the Module, Student, and Registration models (plus optional UserProfile).
3. All module registration logic is based solely on students and modules.
4. Ensure one registration per student per module.
5. All page and view functionality as outlined above.
6. Complete REST API integration.
7. Use Django admin for staff CRUD operations on all models.
8. Consistent templates and navigation throughout.
9. Document Azure deployment, admin setup, and end-user guidance.
